            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>Fauna Café</p>

            <p>Vegetarian Café using only vegetarian, organic, local ingredients</p>

            <h2>Target audience</h2>

            <p>We aim at outreaching to anyone and everyone in the San Luis Obispo area/state of California who have a passion for fresh, beautiful, vegetarian food. We hope to also reach those who aren't necessarily vegetarian or know a lot about the diet, but are interested in learning about what the diet has to offer.</p>

            <p>Primary tasks include learning about our café and the vegetarian diet, as well as viewing our menu.</p>
