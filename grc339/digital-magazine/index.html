                                <p>
                                  Female empowerment is a recurring theme across all aspects of social culture these days. Our feminist fore-mothers’ tremendous fight against injustice in the 1960s has evolved into a multitude of expressions today, from the rewriting of gender norms to intersectionality awareness to eco-feminism and the return to a collective nurturing from a toxic, industrialized, patriarchy. So, what does this movement look like in the board sports space?...

                                  Six days after Myriah Marquez moved to Southern California from the Texas-Louisiana border, she caught wind of a woman named Lucy Osinski that was organizing an all-female skate meetup at Venice Skate Park. It was February 2018, and Marquez was living out of her car under the Los Angeles skies. But she had her board, so Marquez skated out to join the crew. After that meetup, the GRLSWIRL concept was born from a flurry of text messages. It became this safe space for local women who wanted to skate. It became home for Marquez...

                                <p>
                                  The second WSL event of the year was due to kick off at Narrabeen beach today, but due to lack of swell the event has been put on hold for another day. Our very own Billabong team rider, Laura Enever has been granted the elusive wildcard (along with Mick Fanning). It will be the first time she’s pulled on the jersey in four years, but that’s not to say she hasn’t been busy. Laura has been chasing big waves and even made a film about her endeavours, ‘Undone’ which showcases her navigating the unpredictable world of big-wave surfing and sees her tackling some spectacular waves in some of the most remote locations around the world. An absolute must watch, if you haven’t seen it already...

                                  “Women now make up between 20 to 30 percent of surfers, and that number continues to grow,” writes professional surfer/writer Lauren Hill, in the foreword to her new book, “She Surf”. “As girls are given the opportunity and support to engage with the sport, and accessibility to boards and beaches increases, we will make up for lost decades in getting back to surfing’s legacy of inclusivity. As we work to catch up — not to men’s surfing — but to what our own minds, hearts, and bodies are capable of and long for in the water, we are witnessing the depth and diversity of a truly global women’s surf culture.”...
